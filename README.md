In my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in programming and software development, with hands on experience in Python C++, Java and C#, and ongoing skill development in ASP.NET CORE. These programming languages have enhanced my problem solving abilities and deepened my understanding of software engineering principles skills that are highly relevant to Software engineering. My coursework at North-West University has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of information technology, including Data Analysis,Data Structures & Algorithim , OOP,System analysis, Database management, and Information Security.
