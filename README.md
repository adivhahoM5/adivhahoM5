🚀 MULAUDZI ADIVHAHO

🌍In my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in programming and software development, with hands-on experience in Python and C#, and ongoing skill development in Java. These programming languages have enhanced my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of software engineering principles skills that are highly relevant to data engineering. My coursework at North-West University has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of information technology, including Data Analysis,Data Structures & Algorithim , OOP,System analysis, Database management, and Information Security In addition, I have been actively learning about ETL processes, which are critical for building reliable data pipelines. This includes understanding how to extract data from various sources, transform it for analysis, and load it efficiently into data warehouses or analytical platforms. This growing expertise has strengthened my passion for data engineering, especially in designing scalable, high-performance data systems.
