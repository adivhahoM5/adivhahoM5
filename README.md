In my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in programming and software development, with hands on experience (project wise) in Python, C++, Java and C#, and an ongoing skill development in Python's FastAPI Framework. These programming languages have enhanced my problem solving abilities and deepened my understanding of software engineering principles skills that are highly relevant to Software engineering. My coursework at North-West University has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of information technology aspects including: Artificial Intelligence , Data Analysis, Data Structures & Algorithim , OOP , System analysis, Database management, Decision Support System, Computer Networks and Information Security.
